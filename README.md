# Mini projects for arduino

This package contains my scripts that you can load on [mBlock](http://www.mblock.cc/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).
It is part of the [educational repository](http://www.coderdojofosso.it/download/) to learn how to write code by blocks.
Educational repository is an italian page because the material is used by an italian team of [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/).

If you have any problem, create an issue.
